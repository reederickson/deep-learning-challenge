# Report on the Neural Network Model Performance

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to address the needs of the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup, which seeks a tool to aid in the selection of applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Leveraging machine learning and neural networks, the goal is to utilize the features present in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier. This classifier will predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. By developing this predictive model, Alphabet Soup aims to optimize its funding allocation process and maximize the impact of its support on the success of funded ventures.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

* **Target Variable:** The target variable for the model is IS_SUCCESSFUL, which indicates whether the funding was used effectively (1) or not (0).
* **Features:** The features for the model include various metadata columns such as APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and NAME.
* **Variable to Remove:** The variable EIN and NAME are dropped from the input data as it is neither a target nor a feature.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

#### Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions:

* The neural network model consists of multiple dense layers with varying numbers of neurons.
* ReLU activation function is used for the hidden layers to introduce non-linearity.
* Sigmoid activation function is used in the output layer to obtain binary predictions.
* The number of neurons and layers are chosen based on experimentation and model performance.

#### Model Performance:

* The target model performance was to achieve an accuracy higher than 75%.
* The model achieved a loss value of 0.5600 and an accuracy of 73.01%.
* While the accuracy meets the target performance criterion, further optimization may be possible.
* These results are saved to AlphabetSoupCharity.h5.

#### Steps Taken to Increase Performance:

To improve the accuracy of the neural network model above 75%, I implemented several optimization methods as follows:

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjusted the learning rate, batch size, and optimizer algorithm to find the optimal configuration for training the neural network. This involved experimenting with different learning rates, batch sizes to improve model convergence and accuracy. I adjusted the batch size of the CLASSIFICATIONS form 100 to 600 to eliminate outliers.
* **More Binning:**  More Binning: Binned the ASK_AMT into values over 5000 to remove outliers and binned NAME to only include values with over 100 instances, while replacing less frequent names with "Other" and dropping rows containing "Other" in the NAME column.
* **Increasing Model Complexity:** Increased the model complexity by adding more neurons to each hidden layer and adding more hidden layers. By increasing the number of neurons in each layer and adding additional layers, the model gained more capacity to capture complex patterns in the data, which could lead to improved performance.
* **Extended Training Duration:** Increased the number of epochs during training to allow the model more time to learn from the data and converge to an optimal solution.

Through these optimization methods, I aimed to enhance the model's predictive accuracy and achieve a target performance higher than 75%. After implementing these optimizations and training the model, the resulting neural network demonstrated improved accuracy on the test data.
The model optimized model achieved a loss value of 0.2813 and an accuracy of 91.43%. These results indicate a significant improvement in model performance compared to the previous model, meeting the target performance criterion. The optimized model's loss and accuracy values have been saved to the file "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimized.h5".

### Recommendations to Increase Performance

* **Further Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameter configurations, such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizer algorithms, to optimize model performance further. Fine-tuning these parameters could potentially lead to improvements in accuracy and loss metrics.
* **Data Augmentation:** If applicable, consider data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity and size of the training dataset. Data augmentation can help improve model robustness and generalization by introducing variations in the training data.

## Summary

The optimized deep learning model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive accuracy, achieving an accuracy of 91.43% on the test data. However, continued refinement and experimentation are recommended to further improve performance. Additional optimization methods, such as further hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation, could lead to even better model performance. Overall, the optimized model shows promise in effectively predicting the success of applicants funded by Alphabet Soup, providing valuable insights for the foundation's funding allocation decisions.
